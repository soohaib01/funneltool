= 2. What is a Sales Funnel? =
A sales funnel is a process that takes a visitor into a journey to turn him/her into a lead, and then from lead to a sale, and eventually making him/her buy more from your site.

A simple sales funnel usually has 3 sections:

1. Offer Landing Page
2. Checkout Page
3. Thank You Page

But you can add more steps to turn it into a converting sales funnel and generate more profit.

For example, a simple funnel with a lucrative checkout offer would include:

1. Sales Landing Page
2. Checkout Page with Order bump
3. Thank You Page


= 3. Why do I need a sales funnel builder plugin? =

Sales funnels have proven to help online businesses increase conversion rates and revenue.

But it is often difficult to create engaging sales funnel that functions properly.

And most SaaS funnel builders are either too complicated or expensive.

The purpose of WPFunnels is to help you create complete sales funnels within WordPress and without any complications.

= 4. Who can use WP Funnels? =
 For any product or service you offer, you can use sales funnels to increase your conversion.

 And in WordPress, WPFunnels is among the few plugins that can give an easy solution to help you create sales funnels that work.

That being said, the most common businesses using sales funnels are:

- Digital Marketer

- Educational Portal
- Counselor

- eCommerce Shop

However, it's not limited to these niches. Any business can benefit from using sales funnels.


= 5. What type of funnels can I create using WP Funnels? =
With WP Funnels, we have plans to turn it into a plugin that lets you add all necessary steps to create any type of funnels for any purpose.

- lead generation funnels
- product sales funnels
- conversion sales funnels
- checkout sales funnels
- subscription funnels or,
- a mixture of multiple sales funnels into one.


= 6. How long does it take to create a sales funnel using WP Funnels? =
 WP Funnels is designed to make it easy for you to create a sales funnel.

The plugin comes with niche-specific templates which you can tweak and create actionable funnels in as low as 10  minutes.

Plus, you will get actionable guides to help you all the way.


= 7. Do I need any coding and designing skills? =

No. WP funnels come with different types of templates that meet the design and structure requirements to sell different types of products and courses.

So you can simply choose a template and update the content, without worrying about the design and codes.


= 8. What are the basic requirements for WP Funnels to work? =
You will simply need WooCommerce and WP Funnels installed.

Then, depending on your requirements, you can choose your own page builder to design the pages. We recommend using Elementor.

These are enough to start creating funnels.

Currently, WPFunnels works well with Gutenberg, Elementor and Divi page builder. We’re looking to support more page builders soon.

You will get to add important page elements such as the Next Step button, Checkout form, etc when designing your pages.

If you use Gutenberg, Elementor or Divi, you will get their respective blocks, widgets and modules for funnel creation.
